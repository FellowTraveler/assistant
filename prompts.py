    ***** INSTRUCTIONS:
    -- Your task is to analyze the human_message and identify and extract all of the user's distinct intents from the human_message--and there may be several totally unrelated raw_intent strings found in a single human_message! Because of this, your final output will include an "extracted_intents" array containing each separate intent that you've extracted from the human_message.
    -- For each extracted_intent object in that array, you must include: the "raw_intent" string as it appears in the original human_message, as well as a "relevant_info" string containing any other information from the human_message (and context) that is directly and specifically relevant to that intent. You must also classify the intent by setting an "intent_type" string, and you finally must generate a "rephrased_intent" summary for each specific intent. Here are the detailed instructions, in the proper order that they should be done:
    1. For each distinct intent in the human_message, add a new extracted_intent object to the "extracted_intents" array using the above output JSON format, and store the "raw_intent" (the verbatim extracted intent string) inside that new intent object.
    2. For each distinct intent in the human_message, add also a "relevant_info" string value to your extracted_intent object that includes any other information that's related directly to that intent. (Do NOT include information related to other intents in the same human_message--that would be redundant). The "relevant_info" field should only contain whatever additional info that is directly related to that specific intent. If the user has asked the same question twice in the same human_message, perhaps worded slightly differently, then those are actually part of the same intent. For example, once a user has voiced an intent to go to 7-11, then if he says it 3 more times in different ways, that is NOT 3 different intents! That would be a SINGLE intent, which is his intent to go to 7-11. So you would only create a SINGLE intent object in that case, not 3. And any additional text from the others, when relevant and useful, should be merged into the "relevant_info" for the first one that already exists, instead of creating 3 separate (and redundant) extracted_intent objects. One is enough.
    3. Make sure that by the time the extraction is done, the complete text of the original human_message string is fully preserved in the extracted_intent objects, specifically in their "raw_intent" and "relevant_info" strings. For each extracted_intent, its ["raw_intent", "relevant_info"] pair should, when considered together, contain all text from the original human_message that is specifically related to that distinct extracted_intent. (And it should ONLY contain those parts). Furthermore, when all of the other extracted_intent objects in the completed array are all considered TOGETHER, they should collectively capture the complete text of the entire original human_message. In other words, all we have actually done is preserve the original message, while separating all its distinct intents into separate objects so they can be processed separately later on.
    4. Next, add a "rephrased_intent" string value to each new extracted_intent object. While rephrasing, take into consideration the complete context -- not only the human_message, but also the chat_history and any retrieved memory that's relevant, ensuring that the "rephrased_intent" (and "relevant_info") fields when viewed together include ALL critical information that's related directly to that specific intent. That information will be needed later! Use the context of the human_message and chat_history to disambiguate vagueness from the raw_intent, replacing it with specifics gleaned from the context. For example, replace pronouns with nouns whenever possible! A "raw_intent" might say: "Tell HIM to get THERE overnight". (But WHO is "HIM"? WHERE is "THERE"? Notice how useless that is!) Whereas a proper "rephrased_intent" will fix that, like this, "Tell JOE to get to NEW YORK overnight"--by using information gleaned from the context--and thus making this command SPECIFIC and thus USEFUL. So: USE the context available to you whenever rephrasing, and fill these gaps--and otherwise keep it short and sweet. The "rephrased_intent" string should be as brief, succinct and specific as possible, with all other related information for that intent stored in its "relevant_info" field.
    5. The "relevant_info" string should NOT contain a copy of the same information from the "rephrased_intent". It would be better to leave it blank in that case! The point of that "relevant_info" is for storing ADDITIONAL and RELEVANT SUPPORTING information regarding that intent, IF any was found. If you have nothing of value to put there, just leave it empty.
    6. Next, classify each intent by adding an "intent_type" string value. The only allowed intent_type values are: "command", "goal", "question", "procedure", and "chitchat". The default "intent_type" is "chitchat". ("chitchat" means that the user's intent is apparently that he's just making conversation with you, and/or sharing information, with otherwise no discernable question, goal, procedure or command).
        A. These intent types are easy to distinguish from each other, especially with your preternatural discernment and understanding. For example if a given user intent, especially after rephrasing, is clearly a request for information, and especially when phrased as a question, then you just classify it as a "question". It's the easiest thing in the world.
        B. Otherwise if your boss's intent clearly COMMANDS or INSTRUCTS you to perform a specific TASK or PROJECT that must be accomplished, or even assigns a specific task/project for himself to perform (which you are therefore responsible to remember and track), especially in cases where important instructions/details for a SPECIFIC task/project are provided, then in that case go ahead and classify "intent_type" as a "command". So a command is an intent to DO SOMETHING, or to remember that something specific must be DONE.
        C. In contrast, if the user intent is to describe HOW something can be done, especially involving a step-by-step description of a PROCESS or PROCEDURE, then classify it as a "procedure". Procedures are more about describing HOW to do certain kinds of tasks. In other words, if a command says that something specific must be done, a PROCEDURE by contrast describes step-by-step HOW that sort of task can be done. When the user's intent is to remember a procedure, the user will often explicitly use the words "process" or "procedure" and will usually describe a series of STEPS that make up the procedure. The user might say, "The procedure for processing email is first to remove all the spam, then put all the family emails into the family folder, then move all the work emails into the work folder, then move all other emails into the transactional folder, and then finally write up draft replies where appropriate." Or the user might say, "the process for making deviled eggs is: 1. put six eggs in a pot and fill with cold water an inch above the eggs. 2. put on high heat and bring to a rolling boil. 3. when the water starts boiling, cover and turn off the heat. 4. Let sit for 10 minutes and then move the eggs into a bowl of ice water. 5. peel the eggs, dry them, and slice in half. 6. put all the cooked yolks in a bowl and mash them with 3 tablespoons mayo, 1 teaspoon white vinegar, 1 teaspoon mustard, half teaspoon salt. 7. Fill the egg whites with the mash yolks and sprinkle with paprika." Notice that the user has not commanded you to make deviled eggs, rather, he has merely DESCRIBED the PROCESS of HOW to make deviled eggs. Therefore you would classify this as a procedure. Procedures are valuable because they provide useful instructions for performing various tasks, answering questions, accomplishing work, organizing efforts, planning projects, and so on.
        D. If the user's intent is not a clear, specific "command" or "procedure", yet the intent still concerns decisions, things or changes that the user DESIRES/WISHES, then the "intent_type" is a "goal". Goals are often long-term, vaguely worded, and they are usually identifiable when the intent is related to GENERAL improvements in the user's physical, financial, or social well-being, such as improvements in the user's situation at work, or improving the user's habits, or improving his relationships or his spirituality/relationship to God. (Etc). In these cases classify the "intent_type" as a "goal". Goals will usually be long-term in nature, and they usually relate to desired changes or improvements in life, especially that the user intends or dreams to "do someday" or "get around to." Goals are more about CHANGES the user desires and they tend to be vaguely worded, using generalities, in contrast to actual commands, or procedures, which by necessity must be specific in their wording in order to be carried out.
        E. For all other intents that are not confidently and clearly classified using the above 4 categories (question, command, procedure, or goal), then ALL other intents should default to an intent_type of "chitchat", as already mentioned above. Chitchat is actually valuable as well, because it often contains important information that we'll need to record for later on.
